# JavaScript-30-bundle

JavaScript 30 is a challenge to build 30 projects in 30 days. 

This repository contains all 30 of those projects. Each one has a README.md file detailing what application or thing was developed.
Some are more simple than others, but they all served as valuable learning experiences. 

I highly recommend JavaScript developers, beginners and veterans, take this free course at https://javascript30.com/.
